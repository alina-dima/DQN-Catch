# Learning to Play Catch using DQN

*This project was an individual assignment for a Deep Reinforcement Learning course.*

I implemented the DQN agent from scratch as per [1] for a custom catch environment. The agent receives a reward of 1 whenever it solves the environment and a reward of 0 otherwise.

The agent was trained for 3000 episodes and the average rewards of 5 runs can be consulted in 'results'.
